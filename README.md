# Maths-curve
This repository contains practical exercises for learning Python programming. The exercises cover a range of topics, from basic programming concepts to more advanced topics. To get started with the practicals, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Python code. I used Visual Studio Code.
